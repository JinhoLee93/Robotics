# Robotics (Python)

1. Path Planning (Bug1 and Bug2)
    - Brief introductions on the general concept of Motion Planning can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_planning#:~:text=Motion%20planning%2C%20also%20path%20planning,animation%2C%20robotics%20and%20computer%20games.)
    - Bug1 and Bug2 are two of the most fundamental path planning algorithms in robotics.
    - Bug1
        - Bug1 is an exhaustive saerch algorithm, meaning the robot proceeds to find the goal after it completes circumnavigating the obstacles in the environment.
        - The robot fully circumnavigates the boundaries of the obstacles once and it finds the closest point to the next obstacle or the goal before it moves on.
