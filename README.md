# Robotics (Python)

1. Path Planning (Bug1 and Bug2)
    - Brief introductions on the general concept of Motion Planning can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_planning#:~:text=Motion%20planning%2C%20also%20path%20planning,animation%2C%20robotics%20and%20computer%20games.)
    - Bug1 and Bug2 are two of the most fundamental path planning algorithms in robotics.
